# Hexa Golf

Hexa Golf is a fun 3d golf game, where you get to play in three different biomes: meadow, forest and beach. The game it's very simple to play, but really hard to master. As in real life Golf, you can change the club loft (angle of launch), so the ball goes higher or lower. The way you control the direction and force of the ball is by a simple drag-and-shoot system with the left click. Also, you can move the camera, which is third-person based, with the right click. It is also nice that you can choose how many holes you want to play (from 3 to 9). So, what if you cannot hole the ball? It doesn't matter (unless you get too angry), because there is a triple-bogey score limit per hole (3 over par, in all the 2-5 par distances available).
## How many courses are available?
The hole generation is random! So, every hole will look differente, including differnent biomes and amount of trees!
## What does this game offer in gamplay terms?
It is really tempting to go for a hole in one in a par 3, or maybe a par 4, or It can be tempting to go for an eagle in a par 5. But be sure to not miss the fairway though! It can be terribly hard to get out a hole... triple bogey is awaiting.
## If it is a drag-and-shoot game, do I know where the ball is going?
Yes, you do! There is trayectory tracker of the ball before you shoot it. For a hole in one, you have to look very carefully!
## Do I think this game meets the complexity and distinctiveness required?
Totally!! This is a really complex game. There are a lot of interection with the ball with the enviroment. There is a trayectory ball tracker that functions with physics formulas. Also, there is very nice music and sounds, that required singleton instatiaion. Besides, the game over screen, where all the scorecard information is summarized is amazing!: I made a singleton that collects all the data during the golf round and then display everything together in a nice way, independent from the numebr of holes choosen to be played. 

Of couse, there are 3 different game states, that corresponds to menu, play, and game over screens. 

Further more, the golf course generation is procedurally, and that is surely complex and offers a great experience for the player.


## Final comments

By the way, I would like to thank all the people involved in CS50 Game Development. It openned me the door to work as a programmer, and dig into the world of game dev. And this is because it is free!

## Thanks for educating me!
